The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. `React`: This is the library that Next.js is built on top of. It is used in all the `.tsx` files for creating the UI components.

2. `Next.js`: This is the framework used for server-side rendering and routing. It is used in all the `.tsx` files.

3. `TypeScript`: This is the language used for type checking and improved developer experience. It is used in all the `.tsx` and `.json` files.

4. `package.json`: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts. It is shared across all files as it defines the necessary packages required for the project to run.

5. `tsconfig.json`: This file contains the configuration for the TypeScript compiler. It is shared across all `.tsx` files as it defines the rules for TypeScript compilation.

6. `globals.css`: This file contains global styles that are applied across all pages in the application. It is shared across all `.tsx` files.

7. `favicon.ico` and `vercel.svg`: These are static files served by Next.js. They are shared across all `.tsx` files as they are used in the layout of the application.

8. `_app.tsx` and `_document.tsx`: These are special Next.js files that are used to customize the default HTML document structure and initialize pages. They are shared across all `.tsx` files.

9. `index.tsx`: This is the main entry point of the application. It is shared across all `.tsx` files as it is the first file that is loaded when the application starts.

Please note that the specific exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names would depend on the specific implementation of the application and are not known at this stage.
